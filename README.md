ARACHNE Motion Module
=================
[Releases](https://github.com/Team4613-BarkerRedbacks/Arachne-Motion-Module/releases)

The Arachne library was created by 4613 to reduce the time and difficulty in programming FRC robots. It should reduce the required number of files for a complicated robot from over 100 to around 10.

This module contains all classes that introduce complex motion algorithms, such as PID control and our trajectory follower.

It requires the [core Arachne library](https://github.com/Team4613-BarkerRedbacks/Arachne/releases).
